# MNIST

The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
It consist of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

I made a basic neuralnetwork that can recognise 96.5% of the testing images.

You can also draw digits to the program and it will try to recognise them.
